# Scripts

Here are some scripts in python to work on the data.
 - `candle_sticks` plot candle ticks from data in `../data/ticks`.
 - `get_some_ticks` is a dummy code to fetch ticks, feel free to use it to look into asset prices.
 - `word_finder` find the best words in news

 They are all in `jupither python` (`.ipynb`) and `python` (`.py`). It is the same file, only converted for readability.
 You can install jupither notebook following [this link](https://jupyter.org/install) using `pip`.
