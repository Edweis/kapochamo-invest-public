389,Binance Launches VIP Invitation Program,2020-01-20 10:07:15+00,"Fellow Binancians,
Binance is delighted to announce that we will extend the VIP Invitation Program promotion for another 3 months. To help users of other exchange platforms get started on Binance’s spot, margin and futures products, show us your trading volumes on competing exchanges and we will offer you a VIP tier that is one level higher than what you would have received if you had traded this volume on Binance.
Promotion Period: 2020/01/21 to 2020/04/21
Detailed Fee Schedule:

Binance Spot
Binance Margin
Binance Futures 

Detailed Terms: 

Based on your trading volumes on competing exchanges, we will look at what VIP tier level you would qualify for if you traded this amount on Binance. 
To qualify, your past 30 day trading volumes on competing exchanges must be equal to or higher than 50 BTC on spot or 250 BTC on futures.
You will be assigned a VIP tier that is one level higher than what your volumes qualify you for. 

For example, if your 30-day futures volume on another exchange is 225,000 BTC, which is equivalent to VIP 7 on Binance Futures, you can immediately become VIP 8 for the first 3 months through the VIP Invitation Program promotion. 
Or if your 30-day spot volume is 81,000 BTC, which translates to VIP 8 based on Binance spot volumes, we will offer you VIP 9 for 3 months. 

Your VIP tier allows you to enjoy fee discounts and other benefits across the entire Binance ecosystem, whether it’s Spot, Futures, or Margin trading. Please refer to our Key Account Coverage page for more details.
After the three-month period, your VIP tier level will be adjusted depending on your actual trading volume on Binance according to the VIP tier requirements.

How to Apply:
Please email vip@binance.com with details (e.g. screenshots) of your 30-day trading volumes on competing exchanges and if you qualify, a Binance Key Account Manager will get back to you shortly with the next steps.

402,Notice Regarding Upcoming STEEM Network Upgrade,2020-05-23 02:26:41+00,"Fellow Binancians,
In the spirit of transparency, Binance has received a request to upgrade the STEEM network to version 0.23, a hard-fork which includes the following:

An update to reduce the power down (un-staking) time parameter from 13 weeks to 4 weeks, and
Blacklisting of 65 accounts which collectively hold 23.6 million STEEM (currently ~$5 million USD at the time of writing), effectively removing their balances from the STEEM blockchain.

Binance would like to confirm that we do not condone this type of behavior and believe that blockchains should not be used as a tool for censorship or editing user balances. Since receiving the request on May 15th, 2020, Binance decided not to initiate the upgrade, meaning that we have been unable to sync up to the latest STEEM block height, and as such, deposits and withdrawals of STEEM have remained suspended. 
However, this decision has negatively affected all of our existing users that hold STEEM, and is not a long-term solution, as they are currently unable to move their tokens on the blockchain. Thus, in the interest of our users currently holding STEEM, Binance has decided to support this upgrade to provide users with the freedom to use their STEEM tokens as they see fit. 
As a further response to the above, Binance plans to reduce STEEM trading pairs from the current 3 pairs down to 1 pair over the next two months.
Thanks for your support!

How to Trade Options on Mobile Applications 

Important Disclaimers Regarding Options Trading
Premium / Profit Note
The premium is first deducted from the futures wallet balance, and only after is profit calculated. In rare cases, this deduction may cause the futures position to enter liquidation. Before placing an options order, please ensure that you have adequate free margin in your futures wallet balance. Note that to make a net profit on an options trade, the profit must be larger than the premium. Profit will be anything from 0 to infinity, and premium is a fixed value paid at start. Thus options have fixed downside cost paid upfront, and unlimited upside. Net profit for your options trade is profit - premium.
Price Disclaimer
All trades are executed on the market at market price. There is no guarantee that the price you see on screen will be the exact price that you execute at, although it will generally be very close. Small orders, or orders executing during 'normal' market behavior will always be nearly exact, but large orders, or orders that execute during 'volatile' market behavior, may deviate somewhat based on order execution.
Risk Warning
There is no guarantee that your options purchase will execute at a profit after the premium has been deducted. Most options purchases will not be profitable, but a minority will be very profitable. Please use at your own discretion.

Binance is excited to announce that we have launched Isolated Margin and simultaneously listed 11 isolated margin trading pairs, including :

Isolated margin is only available via Binance Spot trading’s advanced interface and is not yet available in Binance’s Spot Basic/Classic trading interfaces or mobile trading apps.
Differences Between Isolated Margin and Cross Margin:

Isolated Margin: margin assigned to a singular position. When the margin level of the trading pair goes lower than the liquidation level, the position will be liquidated, but other assets will not be affected.
Cross Margin: margin that is shared across all of the user’s positions, using the full amount of funds in the available balance. When the margin level of the position goes lower than the liquidation level, all positions will be liquidated, including funds in the available balance.

146,Binance Will Support the Red Pulse Phoenix (PHX) Token Migration to Binance Chain,2019-05-20 12:41:17+00,"Fellow Binancians,
Binance would like to confirm support for the upcoming Red Pulse Phoenix (PHX) token migration of NEP5 PHX tokens to BEP2 PHB tokens on Binance Chain. We will suspend trading, deposits and withdrawals of PHX starting from 2019/05/22 04:00 AM (UTC). 
Due to the rebrand of Red Pulse Phoenix (PHX), we have updated the original PHX ticker to PHB, with its new token name as Red Pulse Phoenix Binance. We will swap these tokens during the migration at a ratio of 1 PHX = 1 PHB. 
Additionally, Binance will open trading for PHB/BNB, PHB/BTC, PHB/USDC, PHB/TUSD and PHB/PAX trading pairs at 2019/05/24 04:00 (UTC). Once trading opens, the previous PHX/BNB, PHX/BTC and PHX/ETH trading pairs will be removed and delisted.
Note:

Original NEP5 PHX tokens can still be deposited to your NEO deposit address on Binance after the swap. We will automatically convert these NEP5 PHX tokens to BEP2 PHB tokens for you.
After the token migration is complete, users will only be able to withdraw BEP2 PHB tokens, not NEP5 PHX tokens. 
Deposits and withdrawals of PHB will open prior to the commencement of trading in the new PHB trading pairs. 

For further information, please refer to Red Pulse’s official announcement at Red Pulse Integrates with Binance Chain.

406,Binance Will Support the JUST (JST) Airdrop Program for TRON (TRX) Holders,2020-05-12 10:51:32+00,"Fellow Binancians,
Binance would like to confirm support for the JUST (JST) Airdrop Program for TRON (TRX) holders. 
Initial JST Airdrop on 2020/05/20
Binance will take a snapshot of all user TRX balances at 2020/05/20 0:00 AM (UTC) for the initial JST airdrop to TRX holders, totalling 217,800,000 JST, or 2.2% of the total JST supply. The airdropped JST amount for each user holding TRX will be calculated as:
JST received by User A = Amount of TRX held by User A at the time of snapshot / Total TRX held by Binance at the time of snapshot * Total JST received by Binance for the airdrop.
Monthly JST Airdrop Program
Binance will also support the JST monthly airdrop program. We will take a snapshot of TRX balances at 0:00 AM (UTC) on the 20th day of each month and distribute JST based on the following calculation:
JST received by User A = Amount of TRX held by User A at the time of snapshot / Total TRX held by Binance at the time of snapshot * Total JST received by Binance based on total TRX holdings for the respective monthly airdrop.
The amount of JST airdropped each month from 2020 to 2022 is as follows:
2020/06/20 to 2021/05/20: 19,800,000 JST airdropped to TRX holders on the 20th day of each month during this period
2021/06/20 to 2022/05/20: 21,450,000 JST airdropped to TRX holders on the 20th day of each month during this period
2022/06/20 to 2022/10/20: 55,440,000 JST airdropped to TRX holders on the 20th day of each month during this period
Please note:

TRX tokens that are pending deposit or withdrawal at the time of each snapshot will not count towards your TRX balance. Please ensure you leave sufficient time for deposits and withdrawals to complete prior to the snapshot.
JST will be distributed to users prior to the 20th day of the following month of each respective snapshot time.
TRX balances under 100 TRX (including those in trade orders) will not be eligible for the airdrop.
For trading and listing of JST on Binance, JST will go through the same strict listing review process as Binance does for any other coin/token. The default position we have is no listing.

For further information, please refer to the original announcement: JUST (JST) airdrops for TRON (TRX) holders.

247,Binance Updates VIP Invitation Program,2020-04-21 07:21:46+00,"Fellow Binancians,
Binance is delighted to announce that we will update the VIP Invitation Program. Show us your trading volumes on competing exchanges and we will offer you a VIP tier that is one level higher than what you would have received if you had traded this volume on Binance for 2 months.
Promotion Period: 2020/04/22 to 2020/07/22
How to Apply:
Please email vip@binance.com with details (e.g. screenshots) of your 30-day trading volumes on competing exchanges and if you qualify, a Binance Key Account Manager will get back to you shortly with the next steps. 
Detailed Fee Schedule:

Binance Spot
Binance Margin
Binance Futures 

Detailed Terms: 

Based on your trading volumes on competing exchanges, we will look at what VIP tier level you would qualify for if you traded this amount on Binance. 
To qualify, your past 30 day trading volumes on competing exchanges must be equal to or higher than 50 BTC on spot or 250 BTC on futures.
You will be assigned a VIP tier that is one level higher than what your volumes qualify you for. 

For example, if your 30-day futures volume on another exchange is 225,000 BTC, which is equivalent to VIP 7 on Binance Futures, you can immediately become VIP 8 for the first 2 months through the VIP Invitation Program promotion. 
Or if your 30-day spot volume is 81,000 BTC, which translates to VIP 8 based on Binance spot volumes, we will offer you VIP 9 for 2 months. 

Your VIP tier allows you to enjoy fee discounts and other benefits across the entire Binance ecosystem, whether it’s Spot, Futures, or Margin trading. Please refer to our Key Account Coverage page for more details.
After the two-month period, your VIP tier level will be adjusted depending on your actual trading volume on Binance according to the VIP tier requirements.

270,Binance Launches Options Trading on Mobile App,2020-04-13 07:41:44+00,"Fellow Binancians,
Binance is excited to announce the official launch of Binance Options trading. Options trading is currently only available on the latest version of our mobile app. 
Update or download the Binance app here:

Binance iOS App (V 2.10.1)
Binance Android App (V 1.21.1)

Further information:

Overview of the Options
About Binance Options
How to Trade Options on Mobile Applications

Important Disclaimers Regarding Options Trading
Premium / Profit Note
The premium is first deducted from the futures wallet balance, and only after is profit calculated. In rare cases, this deduction may cause the futures position to enter liquidation. Before placing an options order, please ensure that you have adequate free margin in your futures wallet balance. Note that to make a net profit on an options trade, the profit must be larger than the premium. Profit will be anything from 0 to infinity, and premium is a fixed value paid at start. Thus options have fixed downside cost paid upfront, and unlimited upside. Net profit for your options trade is profit - premium.
Price Disclaimer
All trades are executed on the market at market price. There is no guarantee that the price you see on screen will be the exact price that you execute at, although it will generally be very close. Small orders, or orders executing during 'normal' market behavior will always be nearly exact, but large orders, or orders that execute during 'volatile' market behavior, may deviate somewhat based on order execution.
Risk Warning
There is no guarantee that your options purchase will execute at a profit after the premium has been deducted. Most options purchases will not be profitable, but a minority will be very profitable. Please use at your own discretion.

We will take a snapshot of all MTL tokens held by Binance users at the above time, and will distribute XPR tokens at a ratio of 1 MTL = 1 XPR.

Please note that trading of MTL will not be affected during the airdrop.
Note:

MTL tokens that are pending deposit or withdrawal at the time of the snapshot will not count towards your MTL balance. Please ensure you leave sufficient time for deposits and withdrawals to complete prior to the snapshot.
MTL balances under 1 MTL (including those in trade orders) will not be eligible to receive the XPR token.
MTL tokens held in sub-accounts will be combined into the corresponding master account. Sub-accounts will not separately receive any XPR tokens.
For the trading and listing of XPR on Binance, XPR will go through the same strict listing review process as Binance does for any other coin/token. Supporting this airdrop does not guarantee the listing of XPR.
XPR tokens will be distributed to users within 14 days of the snapshot time.

For more information on the XPR airdrop, please refer to the following post: How to claim the XPR airdrop by holding MTL.

Terms & Conditions

Returns Calculations:

Individual USDT Profit = Final Account Balance (including unrealized pnl) - Initial Account Balance (including unrealized pnl) + Withdrawals - Deposits - Referral bonuses.
Final USDT Profit for each team = Sum of the top 10 individual USDT profit results within the team.
USDT ROI = USDT Profit Amount / (Initial Account Balance + Time-Weighted Deposits)
Time-Weighted Deposit = Deposits * (Competition time remaining in seconds) / 86,400
Time remaining on each daily ROI competition starts at 86,400 and decreases to 0. Deposits at the start of the competition receive full weight. After 12 hours, deposits will only have a 50% weighting. After 23 hours have passed, deposits will receive a 1/24 weighting and so on.

Leaderboard ranks and results of each daily competition will be updated each day at 0:00 AM (UTC).
Users can win prizes on multiple days as long as they follow each competition’s terms and conditions.
Sub-accounts will not be counted as individual accounts in the team profit activity, but can participate in the daily ROI activity .
Rewards distribution: BNB rewards for each competition will be distributed within 2 weeks after the end of each specific competition, and use the BNB/USDT price at the time of each distribution.
Binance reserves the right to disqualify trades that are deemed to be wash trades, illegal bulk account registrations, self-dealing, or display attributes of market manipulation, etc.
If a team leader is disqualified from the competition, the corresponding 30% reward will be divided equally among all other members of the team. Team members who did not meet 50,000 USDT trading volume on Binance Futures during the activity will not be included.
Binance reserves the right to cancel or amend any Activity or Activity Rules at our sole discretion.

297,Binance Will Support the Upcoming Steem Hard Fork and Distribute the New HIVE Token to STEEM holders,2020-03-18 13:21:21+00,"Fellow Binancians,
Binance will support the upcoming Steem hard fork initiated by the Hive.io team and will distribute the new HIVE token to users holding STEEM. The hard fork is expected to take place at 2020/03/20 2:00 PM (UTC). 
We will take a snapshot of all STEEM tokens held by Binance users at the time of the fina Steem block prior to 2020/03/20 2:00 PM (UTC) and will distribute HIVE tokens at a ratio of 1 STEEM = 1 HIVE. STEEM deposits and withdrawals will be suspended starting from 2020/03/20 1:30 PM (UTC) and will reopen after the hard fork is complete. Please note that trading of STEEM will not be affected during the hard fork.
Note:

STEEM tokens that are pending deposit or withdrawal at the time of the snapshot will not count towards your STEEM balance. Please ensure you leave sufficient time for deposits and withdrawals to complete prior to the snapshot.
STEEM balances under 1 STEEM (including those in trade orders) will not be eligible to receive the HIVE token.
STEEM tokens held in sub-accounts will be combined into the corresponding master account. Sub-accounts will not separately receive any HIVE tokens.
For the trading and listing of HIVE on Binance, HIVE will go through the same strict listing review process as Binance does for any other coin/token. Supporting this hard fork does not guarantee the listing of HIVE.
HIVE tokens will be distributed to users and withdrawals will open once the forked blockchain is deemed to be stable and secure.

For more information on the STEEM upgrade and hard fork, please refer to the following post: Announcing the Launch of Hive Blockchain.

301,Binance Will Support ARPA Chain (ARPA) Staking,2020-03-05 02:58:04+00,"Fellow Binancians,
Binance will be adding support for ARPA Chain (ARPA) staking, starting from 2020/03/06 and will distribute ARPA staking rewards as detailed below:
Monthly ARPA Staking Airdrop Program

Starting from 2020/03/06 at 00:00 AM UTC, Binance will begin taking live snapshots of user ARPA balances.
ARPA Staking distribution will be calculated as follows:ARPA generated by each user = Total ARPA staking rewards received by Binance * User ARPA holdings ratio.
User ARPA holdings ratio = Average user ARPA holdings / Average total ARPA staked by Binance.
Users must hold at least 60 ARPA in order to qualify for staking rewards.
The initial distribution of ARPA staking rewards will be calculated through to 2020/03/31, with the total amount distributed equal to the staking rewards accrued during the period.
ARPA rewards are calculated daily and distributed monthly. Distributions will be completed before the 20th of each month.

Move your coins to Binance from anywhere and enjoy hassle-free staking rewards. Other rewarded coins supported by Binance can be found on the Staking Home Page here.
